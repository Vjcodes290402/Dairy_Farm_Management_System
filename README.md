# Dairy_Farm_Management_System
The Dairy Farm Management System is a web-based application designed to automate and manage daily dairy farm operations. It helps track cow information, monitor milk production, and manage health records and monthly report, improving efficiency and reducing manual errors.

Technologies Used:

1.Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
2.Backend: Java, Java Servlets
3.Database: SQL
4.Tools: Eclipse, Apache Tomcat Server

Poject Built Detailed Explaination: The Dairy Farm Management System is developed using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture to ensure a clean separation of concerns, enhancing maintainability and scalability.

(i) Model: The Model represents the data layer of the application. It handles all the business logic and interaction with the database. In this project, SQL is used to manage and interact with the database, storing information about cows, milk production, health records, and sales.

(ii) View: The View is the user interface of the application. It displays the data to the users and collects their inputs. In this project, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are used to create responsive and interactive web pages that users interact with to manage dairy farm operations.

(iii) Controller: The Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It processes incoming requests, calls the necessary Model methods to retrieve or update data, and then directs the appropriate View to display the results. In this project, Java Servlets are used as the controllers, handling requests and responses between the client and the server.

By following the MVC architecture, the Dairy Farm Management System ensures a structured and organized codebase, making it easier to develop, test, and maintain the application.

Here's a revised version of the steps to run the Dairy Farm Management System on your system:

### Steps to Run the Dairy Farm Management System Project:

1) **Tools Required to Download and Install:**
   - Eclipse IDE for Enterprise Java and Web Developers Edition 2023-12
   - SQL*Plus
   - Apache Tomcat Server

2) **Download and Set Up the Project Code:**
   - Download the complete project code and paste it into the following path:  
     `C://Users//UserName//eclipse-workspace`

3) **Configure the Server in Eclipse:**
   - Open Eclipse and connect to the server using the installed Apache Tomcat Server credentials.

4) **Create the Required Database Tables:**
   - Create the necessary database tables as specified for the project.
     - **Note 1:** SQL scripts for table creation are provided in the project folder.
     - **Note 2:** Use automated commands to generate unique IDs for the tables (e.g., using sequences or auto-increment features).

5) **Run the Project:**
   - Once the server and database are set up, run the project from Eclipse, ensuring it is correctly connected to the Tomcat server.
